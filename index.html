      <h1>Related?</h1>
      <h2 class="rel">Are Unicorns and Rhinos related? That's the big question today.The picture at the top
      of the article is of the Elasmotherium caucasicum, or the giant unicorn.It is rarely
      found and many say it's extinct.The Elasmotherium caucasicum is a close relative to the Rhinoceros it's pretty much
      a giant Rhino. If the Rhino is related to the Elasmotherium caucasicum and if you belive that its a Unicorn then the answer is yes!
      Rhinos and Unicorns <strong>are</strong> related.Well now this quote makes a lot more
      sense!</h2>

          <h1>This to This?</h1>
          <h3 class="hh">From majestic creatures to dancing on rainbows, the story behind it all.
          <br>Once Upon A Time... there was a unicorn who saw a beautiful meadow filled with green
        grass and bright colored flowers he saw a brigde that he could cross to get to the meadow.
      As he started to cross the bridge a troll jumped out from under!
    The troll told the unicorn that he could not cross the bridge without his permission.So the unicorn
  set of to find another way to the meadow.He figured out a way to use his magic to create a rainbow
that he could cross to get to the meadow. Day after day the unicorn went to the meadow, until one day the troll saw him walking across the rainbow.
At that very moment the troll cursed all the unicorns to the skys forever.That is why the unicorns dance across the rainbows.
People have taken this story and made unicorns pink and also barf rainbows. </h3>
